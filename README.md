# Open-Source-Paper
I find the whole Open-Source movement to be interesting because it shows how like-minded people can make change happen if they put their time and energy to it. The beginning of GNU (GNU’s Not Unix) is a great story as well. It is pretty amazing that one person, Richard Stallman, not wanting to be controlled by big operating system companies is what led to the creation of one of the most important tools to the whole movement. 
Richard Stallman is an important part to the whole Open-Source movement. He not only created the GNU software but he also created and pushed the idea of Copyleft which in his words is “Copyright flipped over”. Copyleft is what allows people to truly make their software free and not restricted. Copyleft tells the users that the software is copyrighted but that the authors of the software do give the users the permission to go contribute to the software so long as if they choose to share they share it with the same freedom to other possible users.

I found Bill Gates Open Letter to Hobbyist to be interesting because I can see how his argument may be valid. There are plenty of people who work on things and do not receive any compensation for their work. It reminds me a lot of the music industry. Major recording labels will sign new and upcoming artists and will end up controlling what they can and cannot release to the public. It ends up screwing over the people who work on the projects and the people who want to listen to the projects.
